I am either a big fan of drones in Arma and a good scripter, but sadly Arma's UAV AI logic is very limited, so I decided to create a mod which will enhance Arma's drones logic.

So, in my mod there are basically 2 drone types: operational-tactical and tactical. Operational-tactical UAVs are big, plane-type drones, they mostly search high-priority targets, such as tanks, artillery, rocket systems, supply bases and enemy UAVs operators. They can call high-caliber artillery support, rocket systems support, air strikes, etc. Tactical UAVs are small drones, such as Mavic, they mostly support allied infantry and armored vehicles. They can call mortar support, FPV strikes, small-caliber artillery support, CAS strikes, and they can also report about enemy infantry and armored groups to allied groups.

My mod is compatible with EVERY single UAV in the whole game, but it works just perfectly with next drones: vanilla UAVs, Orlan-30, Zala V-16 and Mavic 3. Bots can also launch these UAVs from tripods, but only from tripods which were placed in Eden Editor, not in Zeus.

Now, what about drones in game? Firstly, if you want your drones to work correctly, you should have an AI UAV operator. He should have UAV terminal in its inventory, and he should be in a safe place in which enemy doesn't see him (or he won't have opportunity to use drones). Let's talk about operational-tactical UAVs. Before searching for an enemy, UAV will gain a height of 2000 metres, so if you place your UAV on an airfield or on low height, it will start working only in some time. But if you place your UAV on an airfield, it will have more exact info about the enemy. After gaining a height, UAV will be flying on enemy territory and finding a target. After finding a target, it will call a strike or report about its target to the nearest ally.
